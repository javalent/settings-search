The Settings Search plugin adds global search functionality to the Obsidian settings, allowing users to quickly search for a particular setting. Keyboard navigation support is provided for ease of use.
Additionally, plugin authors can add their settings dynamically using the API provided by the plugin.
The plugin API includes three functions for this purpose: addResources(), removeResources(), and removeTabResources().

## Features
- Global search functionality added to the Obsidian settings.
- Keyboard navigation support using the up and down arrow keys to move through search results and enter to go to the setting.
- Dynamic settings rendering support using the API for plugin authors to add their settings dynamically.

### Quickstart

1. Install the plugin from the Obsidian community plugins browser.
2. Go to Obsidian Settings
3. Search! That's it. That's the plugin.

Check out the **[plugin documentation](https://plugins.javalent.com/settings-search)** for more detailed instructions and examples.
